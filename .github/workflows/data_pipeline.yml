    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt

    # Step 4: Run data generation, processing, analysis, and visualization scripts
    - name: Generate synthetic genomic data
      run: python data_generation.py  # Generates synthetic data

    - name: Preprocess genomic data
      run: python data_processing.py  # Clean and preprocess the data
